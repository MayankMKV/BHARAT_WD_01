         <h2>NetFlix Clone</h2>
         <p>A Netflix clone is a web or mobile application that emulates the features and functionality of the popular streaming platform, Netflix. Just like Netflix, a clone typically offers a wide variety of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and other content that users can stream on-demand. The purpose of creating a Netflix clone is to replicate the successful model established by Netflix, allowing developers to create their own streaming platforms with similar user interfaces, browsing experiences, and content categorization.</p>
          <h2>Tic Tac Toe game</h2>
          <p>Creating a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.HTML provides the structure of the game board, CSS is used for styling and layout, and JavaScript adds interactivity and game logic.

            In this project, the HTML file sets up the grid-based game board using div elements, typically a 3x3 grid for the Tic Tac Toe layout. CSS is employed to style these divs, creating the appearance of the game board and markers. You can use CSS to add visual effects, like hover animations when a player hovers over a cell.
            
            JavaScript handles the game mechanics and interactivity. It adds event listeners to each cell on the game board, enabling players to click on empty cells to make their moves. The JavaScript code keeps track of the current player's turn, validates moves, checks for win conditions (three in a row), and declares a winner or a draw. It also resets the game when needed.
            
            Overall, this project demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create a dynamic and interactive game. It's a great way to learn the basics of front-end web development and gain hands-on experience with these technologies. As you progress, you can also enhance the project by adding features like a scoreboard, more sophisticated animations, or even implementing an AI opponent for single-player mode.</p>
